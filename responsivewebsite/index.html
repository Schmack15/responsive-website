    <div class="intro-text" id="introText">
      <p>Recently I had a discussion about whether i preferred Cities or suburbs. I said i preferred the suburb because the city feels to busy.</p>
      <p>It can be difficult to tell when the city ends and when the suburb starts.</p>

      <div class="banner2-title">The City</div>
      </div>
      
    <div class="city-text" id="cityText">
      <p>There is a phrase about cities that go “the city never sleeps.” This phrase reflects how cities are busy and things are always happening. This section will go over different aspects of a city that show why the city is busy.</p>

    <div class="city-explain1" id="cityExplain1">
      <p>The city is home to many sounds; horns, voices, TV's and much more. being hit by all these sounds at once can be too much. And for me makes me feel stressed, the city sounds so busy, but usually when I am in a city i am not busy. I feel out of place when in the environment.</p>

    <div class="city-explain2" id="cityExplain2">
      <p>The city can make you feel constricted. The small alleyways and the high amount of traffic work together to make me feel claustrophobic, but the tall buildings make me feel small like I’m at the bottom of a bucket looking up. Just by being in that environment it feels hard to breathe.</p>

      <div class="banner3-title">The Suburbs</div>
      </div>

    <div class="suburb-text" id="suburbText">
      <p>The suburbs are the area that surrounds the city. They are outside of the city but still close enough to be considered in the area. People are more drawn to suburbs since they are perceived to have lower noise levels, cleaner air, and a stronger sense of community.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="suburb-explain1" id="suburbExplain1">
      <p>The suburbs are often associated with lower crime rates and a sense of safety, contributing to their appeal for families and individuals seeking a secure living environment. The communities in suburbs also tend to me more closer together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="suburb-explain2" id="suburbExplain2">
      <p>Suburbs often have lower population densities than urban areas, contributing to a more spread-out and spacious living environment. Suburbs don’t feel as cramped as cities do, there are less people and shorter buildings.</p>
